            What is in it for you?

Perhaps that is selfish, but is the self not the only thing you experience and control in the world? 
Not because of anticapitalism, or worldwide justice, what is in it for you? What keeps you living?

It's not that capitalism and injustice aren't pressing issues or honest motivations. But is that truly why you are in this? 
Maybe you want to feel critical and intellectual. Maybe you need some greater reason, a higher power. Maybe you are scared, hopeless, purposeless. Maybe you are grappling with good and evil. Maybe you love your mom, or your brother, or your teacher, or your friend, or your neighbor. 
Maybe you want to be seen as a heroic and responsible person. Maybe you want to feel emotions deeply. Maybe you don't know what you want except not the world as is.  

That is ok, in fact normal. It is ok that this is what's in it for you. 
You don't have to abstract it, you don't have to prove your reason's righteousness and universality. You just need a reason, and to speak that transparently. Now get to work!
