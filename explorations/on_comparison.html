            ** Very rough notes ** <br><br> 
            Comparison exists in nature for optimization eg. most food, best habitat. Comparison is baked into human language eg. -er, -est. Comparison aids in decision making and comprehension of new things (Perhaps 'association' is better than 'comparison'. The first kind of comparision assumes a hierarchy, some optimal form, while the second kind assumes connection. 
            Perhaps difference focused vs sameness focused). 
            Comparison requires degrees of sameness and difference (global and local mutually influence, no total sameness and no total difference). Comparison is a way to evaluate the self, prove existance relative to others (Assumes desire to measure and quantify, requires a purpose or metric). Comparison becomes more poignant with proximity. 
            Is the reason for comparison more important that the result itself? (We compare out of a need, what are we trying to optimize and why?). Our lives are too complex to possibly isolate factors (We may disillusion ourselves in understanding, then feel frustrated when results don't align). Focus instead: Needs, associations"
