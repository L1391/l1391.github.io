     I honor humility to a very high degree and for a couple years now have adopted the philosophy that praise and blame two ends of the same thing. Both attribute value, positive or negative, to a specific entity or group. I have also adopted the practice of disliking both. It may be more obvious why blame is no good, and this very philosophy is used in restorative justice. Blame neglects the circumstances which may lead people to act. It focuses on punishment and ownership. Blame disregards the interconnectedness of our existance, how no thing is solely one person's responsibility but rather the results of our collective individual actions and systems. 
     Praise, I argue, should be treated the exact same. Praise of a person neglects the luck and circumstances which led a person to be successful. It ignores communities and collaboration. In summary, praise and blame cannot be owned because we are all responsible agents in a world with systemic biases and randomness. Everything and nothing is deserves blame and praise. How then do we proceed? 
     I'm not quite sure, but stay grateful, humble, and accountable.
