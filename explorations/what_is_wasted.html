            The idea of waste is confusing. 
            It is so clear that things are wasted in our world: money, time, talent, food. But what does it mean for something to be wasted? Does nature ever waste? I think not, and thus I think waste relies on both expectation and inequality. We say things are wasted because they didn't meet our standard. We say things are wasted because some people lack what others have in excess. Nature doesn't waste because nature has no expectations and no sustained inequalities.
